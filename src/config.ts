  aboutMe:
    "I am Rishabh Tiwari, a Software Test Engineer certified by ISTQB, specializing in both Manual and Automation testing. I possess a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Amity University, Noida, as well as certifications in ISTQB Foundation Level and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals. I served at IBM India Pvt. Ltd. as an Associate Systems Engineer, where I enhanced the testing approach, defect management, and sprint productivity. Prior to joining IBM, I interned at Collaborative Intelligence Pvt. Ltd., where I developed deep learning pipelines for Object Detection and Tracking. I have a strong interest in software development and computer vision, and I love gaming as well as creating content with imaginative presentations.",
