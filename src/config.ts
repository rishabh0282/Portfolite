  aboutMe:
    "I am a Full-Stack and AI Engineer with industry experience in building production-grade applications and computer vision pipelines. I specialize in Java, Angular, .NET, AI-assisted development, and deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow. I have worked at IBM as a Full-Stack Application Developer, where I built microservices, Angular modules, and enhanced test automation. Previously, at Collaborative Intelligence, I engineered real-time AI workflows for high-resolution object detection. I hold ISTQB and Microsoft Azure certifications, and I enjoy solving real-world problems using scalable software systems and machine learning.",
